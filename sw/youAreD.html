            Job 1:6 and it came to pass one day, that the sons of god came and stood before the Lord, and satan came among them.
            And the Lord said to satan, "where are you from?"Satan answered the Lord, "I went back and forth on the earth, and then I came here.
            "The Lord said to satan, "have you considered my servant job?There is no one on earth like him, blameless and upright, who fears god and shuns evil.
            "Satan answered the Lord, "did job fear god without cause?Have you not put a hedge around him and his house and all that he has?
            You have blessed the work of his hands, and his cattle have multiplied in the land.And now, if you stretch out your hand against all his possessions,
             see that he does not curse you to your face!
            "Then the Lord said to satan, "well, everything about him is in your hand. Only do not stretch out your hand against him."And satan went out from 
            the presence of the Lord.

            After his fall, satan began to fight against god and against the created human race.The fallen angels lost not only their place, but also their authority.
            Banished from heaven by the judgment of god, he floated between the air and the earth, parading about, resisting the righteous and searching for those to
             be swallowed up.(2 Peter. 5:8)
1.After being condemned on the cross, satan continually blinded the hearts of men, made them lust for the world and lust for the flesh, and tempted sinners astray.
(eph. 2:3;2 cor. 4:4;1 jn. 2 15 ~ 16)
2.Satan not only entices the world to sin, he also continually brings charges against the righteous before god.Until the devil, who deceives men, is cast to the ground.
Not until the salvation, power, 
and kingdom of god, and the power of Christ, were fully revealed.(rev. 12:8-10)
3.Satan is not only the enemy of god, but also continually obstructs the work of evangelism, especially against the disciples of Jesus and the faithful ministers 
of god.(mt. 16:22 ~ 23;Lu 22 3 ~ 4;Jn. 27)
